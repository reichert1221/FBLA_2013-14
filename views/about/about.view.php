        The B&B Willow Lake is a refurbished, French-style house from the mid-1800s. Each room has its own electric fireplace, flat screen television and internet. Upon your arrival, please allow one of our staff members to assist you with your luggage.
        Guests are invited to join us for a free, French-themed breakfast everyday.
        There are also many local restaurants to visit as alternatives. Throughout the day, the Courtyard has a wide selection of specialized tea and fresh bread for your enjoyment. The Courtyard can also be rented for business meetings,
        birthday parties, babyshowers, and more. <br><br>
        As the Inn Keeper, I'd like to welcome you, and wish you a pleasant stay!
